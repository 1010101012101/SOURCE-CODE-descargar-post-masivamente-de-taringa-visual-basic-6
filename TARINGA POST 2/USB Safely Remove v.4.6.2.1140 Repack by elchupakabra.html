It saves time and extends user abilities on active work with flash drives, portable drives, card readers and other gadgets.<br /><br />The main disadvantage of using built-in Windows safe removal tool is that in case of having several hot-plug devices it is quite difficult to recognize a device that needs to be stopped. Most devices have the same name: &quot;USB mass storage device&quot;. In addition, Windows does not let you hide a device you would not want to stop from the menu. USB Safely Remove saves you from these problems and offers an original and multifunctional stopping menu, which displays actual device names with icons. Using this menu you can find and stop a device in a snap!<br /><br />After you have stopped a device but did not unplug it, sometimes it is quite useful to return it back into the system. For example, if you remembered that you forgot to write a file to an external drive. In order to do it, you have to physically reconnect the device, however sometimes it's quite inconvenient to do, e.g. if the device is connected to the rear panel of the computer.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center"><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://i4.fastpic.ru/big/2011/0128/86/067afa4ea4e0aefdfed0c61f57a2ca86.jpg" /></div><br /><br /><b>Differences from the original version:</b><br />1.
