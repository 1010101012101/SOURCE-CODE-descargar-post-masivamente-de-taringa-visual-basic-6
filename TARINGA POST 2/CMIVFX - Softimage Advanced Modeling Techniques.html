This video creation was designed to showcase talent at work. Featuring Ubisoft's very own 3D Modeler, Sebastien Giroux, the journey begins with a simple polygon, and turns into a complex mechanical warrior right before your eyes. Edited for time, so that your not waiting around for answers to your questions, we trimmed all the fat and added a killer soundtrack to inspire the mood even further. When it comes to training, AND entertainment, there is clearly only one choice. cmiVFX! Say it to yourself or scream it from a mountain top. It just feels right!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Blocking<br />Since the advent of new computer graphics tools like Mudbox or Zbrush, many new artist are missing the core fundamental principles of constructing something. The ability to solve problems when digital data doesn't want to comply with the end user. Polygons, edges, vertices, all mucking about without purpose or proper parameterization is just not the best way to understand your job as modeler or texture artist. Sebastien takes you through a very cool way of building your objects in proxy so that you can understand the form for later retopology. Don't mistake the fact that everything good in life comes in stages. Wether is crawling before walking, or in our case blocking before modeling details, recognize the journey for what it is and what it can do for you. Basically, DON&quot;T PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE.<br /> <br />Rebuilding<br />One a prototype is built, and tested for visual satisfaction, it can then be constructed for proper use.  Just like a clay model of a car shape, it will need to go to tool and die. We show you how to rebuild your model with the proper geometrical parameterization that is required for highly detailed renderings. There is no fun in seeing jagged edges, unwanted creases, and odd moire patterns from poor surface generation. Sit back and relax while we show you how its done.<br /> <br />Details<br />It's ALL in the details. This is what makes a Toyota turn into a Lexus luxury sedan. DETAILS.  We wont be adding leather and 5 position seats, but we will show you how to increase the visual experience by detailing your models with topology enhancements. Each part should integrate accordingly and run smoothly as the eye passes over it. If you see an area that is just not as good as the rest of your model, then you know your missing detail. Watch as Sebastien solves intricate problems to detailing situations.<br /> <br />Accessories<br />Everything that humans know is accessorized.  The very clothes that you wear, can be considered accessories. Our model needs some as well, and all the models you create will too. This section of the video shows off the modeling skill of a veteran production modeler as he banks every turn through to the end of the video. So many cool ideas will be popping up in your minds as you watch, that we wouldn't be surprised one bit if you pause the video and start working on one of your projects immediately.  Watch the finishing of the model and enjoy the satisfaction of seeing it completed.<br /><br /><br />About The Author<br />Sebastien Giroux has been working for 8 years in the field of 3D Animation field while residing in Montreal, Canada.
