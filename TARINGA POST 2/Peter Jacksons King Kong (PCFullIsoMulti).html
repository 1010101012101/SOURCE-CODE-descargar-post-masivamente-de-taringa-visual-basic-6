As the long-winded title suggests, this is the game based on the upcoming retelling of the 1933 film by the Academy Award-winning director of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br /><br /><br />Screenshot:<br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://www.uploadpix.org/images/2lvl.jpg" /><br /><br /><br />King Kong feels more like a stand-alone product than a handy cash-in for the license, however. This game blends the aforementioned first-person action sequences with its third-person (or should it be third-gorilla?) components remarkably well, as you traverse the perils of Skull Island as both screenwriter Jack Driscoll and the 800-pound gorilla himself, King Kong. It also helps that both components, on their own standing, can be a great deal of fun when the game is at its best--which, fortunately, is the majority of the time. Unfortunately, even the majority of the time isnt very long in the case of King Kong, a game that wont take you more than a single afternoon to beat. But that afternoon will be well spent.<br />Setup Instruction<br /><br />1- Extract Rar File<br />2- Mount ISO file with DAEMON Tools (Or whatever)<br />3- Instal the Game<br />4- Play  y  Have Fun ....................
