The author presents many different uses/tests done with very simple graphs that might influce the way the rest of the work is developed.<br /><br />Initializing Data<br />This lesson will show how to initialize scalar data in an object, and how that compares to the way the standard WeightMap tool works in XSI. We try to mimic the initialization of such a tool in ICE.<br /><br />Display Data<br />Using a standard Weightmap we will display the ICE data created in the pevious lesson. This explores the concept of computing data in ICE, and displaying/connecting to non-ICE features in XSI.<br /><br />Improving The Base<br />This lesson we explore the first flaws on the basic level of the system, and how to solve them to guarantee a better environment to further develop the tool. By doing such abstractions now, we will be able to expand the system in the future by thinking of the global aspect of the tool from the ground up.<br /><br />Distance from Null<br />Using the length property of a vector we will create a soft distance field from a null center and use that to build the system foundation of changing values in the point set.<br /><br /><br />Implementing Features<br />We identify the features needed on the previous node and start working on that. We will see how to add a Motion Sensivity term to activate the painting as well as sharpness control.<br /><br />Mess with Time<br />This lesson goes into understanding how time works and how we can use time to gradually control the gradual decay of the values stored in the surface of a mesh.<br /><br /><br />Dispersion<br />We explore how to propagate the values through the mesh points by adding a few terms to control the speed propagation and the logic that distributes and blends value between neighboring points. The addition of this feature makes it possible to many different effects in the same tool.<br /><br />Distance From Geometry<br />We basically get all we have done, and expand the system to interact with polymeshes and particles. By changing very few things in the Distance from Null node we finish with a very flexible system!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Home page:  http://www.cmivfx.com/tutorials/view/212/Softimage+ICE%3A+Scalar+Data<br /><br /> <br />descargar<br /><br />http://www.fileserve.com/file/Vqnmaxf/CMIVFX Scaler Data.part4.rar<br />http://www.fileserve.com/file/ghfcM7s/CMIVFX Scaler Data.part3.rar<br />http://www.fileserve.com/file/EQzxnrP/CMIVFX Scaler Data.part2.rar<br />http://www.fileserve.com/file/SWNPn5z/CMIVFX Scaler Data.part1.rar<br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://proton.ucting.udg.mx/galeria/mis%20botones/FLUJO.GIF" /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://www.imagenesya.com.ar/imagenes/129310430152423900.gif" /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://proton.ucting.udg.mx/galeria/mis%20botones/FLUJO.GIF" /><br /><br /> </div>								</span>
