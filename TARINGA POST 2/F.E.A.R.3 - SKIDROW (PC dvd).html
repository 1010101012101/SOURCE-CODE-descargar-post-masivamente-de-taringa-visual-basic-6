Interactive<br />Developer: Day 1 Studios<br /><br /><br />Description: Nine months ago, Point Man and his F.E.A.R. squad were tapped to stop a telepathically gifted cannibal who had begun a murderous rampage. Point Man learned the target was his brother, Paxton Fettel, working alongside their tortured and psychically powerful mother, Alma Wade. Despite this revelation, Point Man followed orders to destroy them and subsequently ravaged the surrounding city and most of his F.E.A.R. team. Now, it is clear that Alma’s psychic influence survived— and worse, she is about to birth something that could destroy the world.<br /><br />Fettel has returned from death with an unclear agenda, refusing to leave Point Man’s side and asking for help to reach Alma. The remaining F.E.A.R. squad is still trying to complete their mission. With his chain of command broken and Point Man calling his own shots, where will his allegiance lie?<br /><br />Features:<br /><br /># F.3.A.R delivers all the hallmarks that define the F.E.A.R. brand: terrifying paranormal horror, frenetic combat, and a dramatic storyline.<br /># F.3.A.R. evolves the brand, introducing Divergent Co-op: deep, social gameplay that gives players distinctly different abilities that affect their own play as well as the experience of gamers they are playing with…or against.<br /># Proprietary technology creates random scare events to increase the feeling of isolation and unpredicatability when playing alone or with a friend, and offers new experiences each time gamers play through.<br /># Active 360 degree cover, evolutionary slow-mo modes, phasing portal systems and best in class mech combat aid players in facing an army of soldiers and paranormal enemies.<br /><br />Minimum system requirements:<br /><br /># OS: Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 with DirectX 9.0c<br /># Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4Ghz, AMD Athlon X2 4800+<br /># RAM: 2GB RAM<br /># Graphics: NVIDIA 8800 GT 512MB RAM, ATI 3850HD 512Mb RAM or better<br /><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://i1189.photobucket.com/albums/z432/mrelfee/ii/fe12c5-1.jpg" /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://i1189.photobucket.com/albums/z432/mrelfee/ii/cba520-1.jpg" /><br /><br /><br />Download<br /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">
