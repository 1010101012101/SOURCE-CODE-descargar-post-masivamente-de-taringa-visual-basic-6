The game was developed by Ubisoft Montreal, developers of Splinter Cell, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory and the sixth generation versions of Splinter Cell: Double Agent. Key members of the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas team, such as creative director Maxime Beland, also worked on the game. Splinter Cell: Conviction introduces a number of new gameplay features to the series, one of which is the Mark and Execute feature, which allows the player to mark specific targets, such as enemies or objects, and shoot them when they burst through a door or window. The player can choose to prioritize these targets, so that, for example, he could distract one guard by shooting out a light in his vicinity and then take out another guard.<br /><br />Another new feature is the 'Last Known Position', which occurs when the player breaks the line of sight of an alerted guard. This creates a visual silhouette of where the guard thinks Sam is, allowing the player to strategically flank his enemies. Main target subjects can use the player's abilities against them. The player can be taken hostage by the subject in co-op mode; the hostage's partner can neutralize the subject by shooting them or grabbing them off his teammate.<br /><br />Game Features:<br />NEW LEVEL OF ACTION FOR SPLINTER CELL A full arsenal of cutting-edge innovations allows you to outflank foes with the Last Known Position system, tag and eliminate enemies using the Mark and Execute feature, and much more.<br />BLOCKBUSTER EXPERIENCE A unique storytelling style keeps you on the edge of your seat as you navigate the explosive world of a renegade agent where trust is impossible and justice requires you to go above the law.<br />JAW DROPPING VISUALS A revolutionary new graphic direction delivers an utterly seamless gameplay experience that'll keep you totally engrossed in the story of Sam Fisher.<br />EXPLOSIVE ONLINE PLAY Brand-new addictive multiplayer modes amp up the dramatic intensity like never before.<br /><br />System Requirements:<br />OS: Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7<br />Processor: 1.8 GHz Intel Core2 Duo or 2.4 GHz AMD Athlon X2 64<br />Memory: 1.5 GB Windows XP / 2 GB Windows Vista, Windows 7<br />Graphics: 256 MB DirectX 9.0c-compliant video card (512 MB recommended) (see supported list*)<br />DirectX: DirectX 9.0c<br />Hard Drive: 10 GB<br />Sound: DirectX 9.0c-compliant sound card<br />Peripherals Supported: Mouse, keyboard, headset, 12-button gamepads with analog sticks<br />Internet Connection: Broadband Internet connection<br /><br />Features RePacks:<br />It is based on a license from Russobit m<br />None of which is converted<br />Set 5 minutes (turn off anti-virus software before installing)<br />Removed Multiplayer and logo development<br />Starting from the office desk<br /><br />Download :<br /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">
