If one knows and understands upper body ties and takedowns, he can score an easy takedown from the clinch position. This is the reason so many Greco roman wrestlers do well in NHB fighting (Matt Linland, Randy Couture, Dan Henderson). They use upper body ties to score effortless throws and takedowns on opponents. Understanding the clinch position also affords fighters a chance to rest and recover. Rather than fight to keep from getting thrown you can re-group and strategize before resuming the fight. <br />Anyone who studies this series will find it easy and very helpful for learning how to score upper body throws on opponents in NHB fighting.<br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/f9c24a.jpg" /></p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><b>NO PASSWORD</b><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/aacd40.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">

Toward the beginning of Hadrians reign in A.D. 118, Gaius Petreius Ruso, a doctor originally from Gaul, has attached himself to a contingent of the Roman army, the 10th Batavians, en route to the northern edge of the Roman Empire in Britannia. When Felix, a soldier, is found beheaded, the prefect of the 10th Batavians, Decianus, assigns Ruso to investigate, despite a confession to the murder by Thessalus, retiring medic to the Tenth Batavians Bedbugs. Decianus is concerned that the attack presages further unrest from the locals, who ascribe the killing to their antlered god, Cernunnos. Reluctantly, Ruso probes Thessaluss motives for admitting the crime and finds that many others also had an interest in seeing Felix dead. This well-researched novel places Downie alongside such established masters of the Roman historical as Steven Saylor and Rosemary Rowe.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><b>NO PASSWORD</b><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/aacd40.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">
