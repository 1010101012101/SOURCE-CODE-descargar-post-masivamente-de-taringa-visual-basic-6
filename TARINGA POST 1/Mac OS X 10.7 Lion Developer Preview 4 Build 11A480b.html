Here is a brief overview of some great features.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;">App Store for Mac:</span><br /><br />The best way to search and download the applications for the Mac.

Install the application can be purchased with one click, and a second later it is displayed in a new Launchpad. App Store for Mac now available on any Mac running Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
