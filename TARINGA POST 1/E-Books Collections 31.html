Sure there are those for whom portait drawing is a God-given talent, but everyone no matter what their 'talent' level must study and acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to grow and develop as an artist.<br /><br /><b>ArtAcademy - Mastering Portrait Drawing 1</b><br /><br />Being able to consistently get a remarkable likeness in your face and portrait drawing can be learned. But there is a skill-set that must be acquired. The first is the ability to strike the arabesque, that is the entire outside shape of the head. The arabesque encompasses the overall shape and proportion. From there, one constructs the portrait by fixing the facial proportions and then blocking in the initial tone.<br /><br />Even at this very early stage the likeness of the sitter will begin to emerge in the portrait drawing.<br /><br />The next requirement is knowledge-based: to make sense of and convincingly render the features and supporting cast of cheeks, chin, forehead, etc. you must know the underlying anatomy of bone and muscle.<br /><br />Anatomy plays a crucial role in conveying emotions. There are different muscles actions for joy and for melancholy. It is more than just a smile on the lips.<br /><br />Once you attain the skill-set of portrait drawing you will find it to be immensely satisfying and your growth as an artist will accelerate. Seeing the likeness of your loved one or client or model emerging from the paper under your hand is a real accomplishment. Much better than to forever be struggling with the basics of portrait drawing with little or no progress.<br /><br />You will find all of the tools you need to develop your portrait drawing to a high-level in my Mastering Portrait Drawing 1 DVD Workshop: The Frontal Pose.<br /><br /><b>ArtAcademy - Mastering Portrait Drawing 2</b><br /><br />Mastering Portrait Drawing 2 is the second of my Mastering Portrait Drawing Series of DVD workshops. Part one introduced you to all the fundamental techniques, methods and knowledge you need to successfully draw beautiful realist portraits in the Frontal Pose.<br /><br />Now we take you on the next step of the journey and teach you all the procedures and know-how you will need to excel at the fine art of realist portraiture in the profile views.<br /><br />Step by step you will learn in-depth the secrets to the mastery of the 7/8 profile view - the favored profile of Masters for it's three dimensionality, it's movement, it's elegance, emotional quality, and timeless appeal.<br /><br />If you loved Mastering Portrait Drawing1 and have been studying diligently, you are going to be doubly thrilled to get started on the popular 7/8's profile view in Mastering Portrait Drawing 2 now that you have the basics down.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><b>NO PASSWORD</b><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://www.minimages.com/images/93772426617259585667.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">

With thirty lessons, including drills, clear explanations, and vivid examples, readers will become familiar with the fundamental patterns of Japanese grammar while learning important vocabulary. This book also features a bonus glossary of more than 160 basic kanji to assist in the learning process. Japanese in MangaLand is a wonderful alternative to reading page after page of dry prose. Perfect for both beginners and manga enthusiasts, this book makes learning the basics of Japanese both fun and easy. <br /><br /><b>Japanese in Mangaland 2: Basic to Intermediate Level</b><br /> ike the original Japanese in MangaLand, the second volume in the series combines the phenomenal popularity of manga with language instruction to make learning Japanese easier and a lot more fun than with traditional approaches. Japanese in MangaLand Vol. 2 helps even beginning students master the basics of conversational Japanese with fifteen lessons including drills, the patterns of Japanese grammar and more than 360 kanji characters to assist in the learning process. Eleven of these lessons cover such grammar topics as intransitive/transitive verbs, particles, honorific expressions, and even dialects and proverbs.<br /><br /><b> Japanese in Mangaland 3: Intermediate</b><br /> Japanese in MangaLand 3 covers all the requirements of grammar, vocabulary and kanji of Level 3 (Intermediate) of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, as well as offering many exercises, grammar and vocabulary reference appendixes (especially designed for Proficiency Test candidates) and many other features. And, in the fall of 2007, when high schools around the country begin offering Advance Placement courses in Japanese, these entertaining and user-friendly instructional materials will surely find an even wider audience. <br /><br /><b> Kanji in Mangaland</b><br /> The Japanese in MangaLand series from JPT introduced language learners to an innovative, entertaining and educationally-sound way of learning Japanese through the use of manga. Now, this same approach is applied to the often-daunting task of mastering kanji -- the Chinese ideograms in Kanji in MangaLand, the first of a 3-volume course covering the 1,006 basic kanji characters.<br /><br /><b> Japanese in Mangaland: Workbook 1</b><br /> Now comes the Japanese in MangaLand Workbook 1, a perfect way for readers to practice and assimilate what they learned in the first volume. The Workbook offers more than 150 complementary activities, divided into six sections that enable students to practice writing hiragana, katakana and kanji, as well as to optimize the vocabulary and grammar that were taught in the textbook itself. An exciting special feature-24 pages of a Rakujo manga created exclusively for this workbook-further enhances the learning experience.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><b>NO PASSWORD</b><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://www.minimages.com/images/93772426617259585667.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">
