Our project differs from official distribution provided by Christian Ghisler on www.totalcmd.com site. Total Commander Ultima Prime is a special distribution of Total Commander with many useful third-party add-ons, plug-ins and customisations. It also contains extended main menu and toolbar, other programs, changed layout and other elements.<br />We provide our customization work as freeware in the form as it is but please remember that Total Commander itself is distributed as shareware. Please keep in mind, that other contained applications licenses might differ and not be proper for commercial purposes too. Detailed descriptions of the software can be found on the forum board.<br /><br /><b>Total Commander Ultima Prime 5.5 + Key</b><br /><a href="http://www.sharingmatrix.com/file/1104786294" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sharingmatrix.com/file/1104786294</a><br /><a href="http://www.easy-share.com/1915806567" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.easy-share.com/1915806567</a><br /><a href="http://depositfiles.com/files/5qsr3ey3v" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://depositfiles.com/files/5qsr3ey3v</a>								</span>
