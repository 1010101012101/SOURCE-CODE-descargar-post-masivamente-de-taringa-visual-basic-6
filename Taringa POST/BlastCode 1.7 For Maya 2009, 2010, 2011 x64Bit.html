Its highly interactive design greatly reduces the time needed to develop totally unique blast scenarios. Blast Code provides animators the ability to test a multitude of destruction scenarios, and quickly make adjustments to any part of the simulation.<br /><br /><b>Kiloton</b><br /> Blast Code &quot;Kiloton&quot; is the ideal tool for destroying any NURBs surface. You can precisely control the exact degree and pattern of bending, cracking, and shattering of any material you choose with amazing realism.<br /> In addition to all the standard features, Blast Code &quot;Kiloton&quot; contains our most popular fracturable surface called &quot;slabs&quot;.<br /><br /><b>Megaton</b><br /> Blast Code &quot;Megaton&quot; combines all the tools necessary to create stunning demolition effects.<br /> In addition to all the standard features, Blast Code &quot;Megaton&quot; contains slabs, sweep, and details.<br /><br /><b>Blast Code Operation</b><br /> Blast Code models are manipulated through NURBs control surfaces. Control surfaces are used to convey deformation information to geometry attached to them. They are usually not part of the rendered scene.<br /> The geometry making up the model to be blasted is produced by either:<br /> Converting the control surfaces into fracturable meshes. (Slabs)<br /> Creating fracturable sweeps along NURBs curves. (Sweeps)<br /> Attaching pre-existing geometric objects (NURBs or meshes) to the control surfaces. (Glue Objects)<br /> Fragmentation is achieved using random or custom crack patterns.<br /> Virtual destructive energy sources called explosives are attached to the control surfaces, and are used to fragment the models into debris. Debris is jettisoned from the control surface based on the force and direction of the charge and its type of material.<br /> Dynamics are then added to the debris to achieve the resulting flight trajectory and collision characteristics.<br /> Finally, optional smoke or fire is added using the built-in particle emitters.<br /> This method has proven to be very fast and effective in producing complex simulations, and remains very flexible when modifying any part of the simulation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/z-AZ-tEMZJg?fs=1&version=3" quality=high width="640px" height="385px" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allownetworking="internal" autoplay="false" wmode="transparent"></embed></center><br /><br />link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-AZ-tEMZJg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-AZ-tEMZJg</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=GJGDK3JV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Download</a></div>								</span>
