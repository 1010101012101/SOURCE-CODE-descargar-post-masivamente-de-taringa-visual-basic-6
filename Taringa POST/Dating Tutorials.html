The pick-up artist and seduction communities quickly became the ebook's fan base since its release.<br /><br />The reviews from the book's fans have been mostly enthusiastic. Many of the user reviews have guys revealing that they have not really progressed significantly although they have studied a lot of dating advice. Until, that is, they were aware of the 4 Elements of Game. Users claim that it gave them the ability to improve their success with women and has changed the way they look at &quot;The Game&quot; completely.<br /><br />Ok. So that's what several of the users say. But just how applicable is this ebook? What do experts think about it? Will it really boost your chances of getting the results you are looking for with women? What's so extraordinary about this ebook that separates it from the hundreds of other dating advice products out there?<br /><br />The Dating Skills Review Editors' Choice award was recently granted to The 4 Elements of Game ebook. This award is only granted to a select few extremely high quality pieces of dating advice. So, clearly, experts think that it is a great product.<br /><br />Let's dive in and learn a little more about it with a short 4 Elements of Game review.<br /><br /><b>The Good Perks.</b><br /><br />The ebook is very factual. Where as other books show a lot of topics without really elaborating on it, this book is exceptional. It stays in line with the most vital things you need to know. Even if you read only up to 20% of the book, it is enough to guarantee the quality of the remaining 80%.<br /><br />For it to be used with ease, the ebook is also simply related. To make the concepts easily understood, this ebook was carefully written. And it's also a great value for your money.<br /><br /><b>The Conclusion.</b><br /><br />This ebook is really worth the money you will pay it for. The simplicity and practicality of the tips in this ebook makes it the optimum place for newbies to start. It's also something that guys who have read a lot of dating advice and are feeling cluttered with it should read for them to clear things up. It does a very good job at 3 things:.<br /><br />1. Supporting you in focusing on the things that will make the most difference (Prioritizing).<br /><br />2. Giving you simple and efficient advice.<br /><br />3. Enabling you to modify what you need to change based on where you are today while making use of your natural skills and abilities to do so (where you start off).<br /><br />Only part of the videos are from Rob Judge (Or from Zack, his partner).<br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i24/59e415.jpg" /></p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/c253de.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">
