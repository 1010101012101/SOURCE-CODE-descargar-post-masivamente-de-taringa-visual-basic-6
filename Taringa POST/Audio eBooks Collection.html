(June 28, 2011) | ASIN: B004HW77Y4 | MP3 64Kbps | 429 MB</b><br /><br />In Blood of the Reich, critically acclaimed and bestselling author William Dietrich weaves two stories separated by place and time yet deeply intertwined by the dangerous secret they share.<br />On the eve of World War II, explorer Kurt Raeder receives orders from ReichsfUhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler to set out from Berlin in search of a legendary energy source hidden among the mountains of Tibet-one that could bring victory to the Nazis. <br /><br />Only one man can stop Raeder and his team of SS officers: wealthy American zoologist Benjamin Hood. Together with aviatrix Beth Calloway, he must race to the Buddhist kingdom before the tides of history run red with blood.<br />Decades later, in present-day Seattle, software publicist Rominy Pickett is saved from certain death by a mysterious journalist who claims to know the truth about her family. Rominy-s history and courage hold the key to defeating, once and for all, the evil forces again on the rise.<br />Moving from the remote woods of the Pacific Northwest to the underground laboratories of the CERN supercollider in France and Switzerland and to the mystical temples of Tibet, Blood of the Reich is a white-knuckle thrill ride filled with adventure, authentic historical detail, and unforgettable characters. This is William Dietrich at his very best.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/c253de.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">

In this demonic race, native tribesmen became miners. Sometimes they became thieves. And then they became rebels. <br /><br />Zouga Ballantyne, an African-born Englishman, sees the Devil's Own mine as his ticket to the North: a realm of waterfalls and fertile plains, teeming wildlife, and seeded fields of gold. But what happens in the diamond mines of the fledgling Boer Free State sets the course for Ballantyne and a cast of comrades, enemies, and lovers--and for the continent itself.<br />From the visions of imperialists to the fury between a father and a son, from the lengths a man will go for a woman and a woman for her convictions, a tragic clash of generations and civilizations was shaking 19th century Africa, where some warriors fought for their gods--and others for the men who came before them...</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/c253de.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">

Asimov was one of the most prolific writers of all time, having written or edited more than 500 books and over 9,000 letters and postcards.[2] His works have been published in nine of the ten major categories of the Dewey Decimal System (The sole exception being the 100s: philosophy and psychology, although he did write a foreword for The Humanist Way, which is published in the 100s).[3]<br />Isaac Asimov is widely considered a master of hard science fiction and, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, he was considered one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; science fiction writers during his lifetime.[4] Asimov's most famous work is the Foundation Series;[5] his other major series are the Galactic Empire series and the Robot series, both of which he later tied into the same fictional universe as the Foundation Series to create a unified &quot;future history&quot; for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by Cordwainer Smith and Poul Anderson.[6] He wrote many short stories, among them &quot;Nightfall&quot;, which in 1964 was voted by the Science Fiction Writers of America the best short science fiction story of all time. Asimov wrote the Lucky Starr series of juvenile science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.<br />The prolific Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much non-fiction. Most of his popular science books explain scientific concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. He often provides nationalities, birth dates, and death dates for the scientists he mentions, as well as etymologies and pronunciation guides for technical terms. Examples include his Guide to Science, the three volume set Understanding Physics, Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery, as well as numerous works on astronomy, mathematics, the Bible, William Shakespeare's works and chemistry subjects.<br />Asimov was a long-time member and Vice President of Mensa International, albeit reluctantly; he described some members of that organization as &quot;brain-proud and aggressive about their IQs.&quot;[7] He took more joy in being president of the American Humanist Association.[8] The asteroid 5020 Asimov, a crater on the planet Mars,[9] the magazine Asimov's Science Fiction, a Brooklyn, New York elementary school, and one Isaac Asimov literary award are named in his honor.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/c253de.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">

Tracking the continual transformation of faith from the Stone Age to the Information Age, Wright, a self-described materialist, best known for his work on evolutionary psychology, free trade, and game theory, postulates that religious world views are becoming more open, compassionate, and synthesized. Occasionally, his prescriptions can seem obvious-for instance, that members of the different Abrahamic faiths should think of their religions as -having been involved, all along, in the same undertaking.- But his core argument, that religion is getting -better- with each passing aeon, is enthralling.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/c253de.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">

Shaped in movements like a verbal symphony, the novel follows half-demon foundling Gard from a pastoral childhood punctuated with vicious raids by the savage Riders. Gard's willingness to kill in self-defense leads to a career as gladiator and sex slave under the insatiable Lady Pirihine and his training as a powerful mage, all contrasted with and eventually tied into the Gospel-like story of the Star, a John the Baptist-like figure, and the Child, a young girl who becomes a saint. Somehow this unusual and mostly charming melange of basic fantasy motifs, fair and feral landscapes, and ironic characterizations ranging from gentle to raucous all comes together harmoniously, like extended variations on the theme that achieving adulthood is not for fainthearted sissies.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/c253de.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">

European royalty sought out his secret elixir against poison. His life inspired Mozarts first opera, while for centuries poets and playwrights recited bloody, romantic tales of his victories, defeats, intrigues, concubines, and mysterious death. But until now no modern historian has recounted the full story of Mithradates, the ruthless king and visionary rebel who challenged the power of Rome in the first century BC.<br /><br />In this richly illustrated book--the first biography of Mithradates in fifty years--Adrienne Mayor combines a storytellers gifts with the most recent archaeological and scientific discoveries to tell the tale of Mithradates as it has never been told before.<br /><br />The Poison King describes a life brimming with spectacle and excitement. Claiming Alexander the Great and Darius of Persia as ancestors, Mithradates inherited a wealthy Black Sea kingdom at age fourteen after his mother poisoned his father. He fled into exile and returned in triumph to become a ruler of superb intelligence and fierce ambition. Hailed as a savior by his followers and feared as a second Hannibal by his enemies, he envisioned a grand Eastern empire to rival Rome. After massacring eighty thousand Roman citizens in 88 BC, he seized Greece and modern-day Turkey. Fighting some of the most spectacular battles in ancient history, he dragged Rome into a long round of wars and threatened to invade Italy itself. His uncanny ability to elude capture and surge back after devastating losses unnerved the Romans, while his mastery of poisons allowed him to foil assassination attempts and eliminate rivals.<br /><br />The Poison King is a gripping account of one of Romes most relentless but least understood foes.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/c253de.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">

Schwartz has spent his career studying the structure and neuronal firing patterns of the human brain. He pioneered the first mindfulness-based treatment program for people suffering from OCD, teaching patients how to achieve long-term relief from their compulsions.<br /><br />For the past six years, Schwartz has worked with psychiatrist Rebecca Gladding to refine a program that successfully explains how the brain works and why we often feel besieged by bad brain wiring. Just like with the compulsions of OCD patients, they discovered that bad habits, social anxieties, self-deprecating thoughts, and compulsive overindulgence are all rooted in overactive brain circuits. The key to making life changes that you want-to make your brain work for you-is to consciously choose to &quot;starve&quot; these circuits of focused attention, thereby decreasing their influence and strength.<br /><br />As evidenced by the huge success of Schwartzs previous books, as well as Daniel Amens Change Your Brain, Change Your Life, and Norman Doidges The Brain That Changes Itself, there is a large audience interested in harnessing the brains untapped potential, yearning for a step-by-step, scientifically grounded and clinically proven approach. In fact, readers of Brain Lock wrote to the authors in record numbers asking for such a book. In You Are Not Your Brain, Schwartz and Gladding carefully outline their program, showing readers how to identify negative brain impulses, channel them through the power of focused attention, and ultimately lead more fulfilling and empowered lives.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/c253de.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">
