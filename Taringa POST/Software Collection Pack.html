You have absolutely everything you need to produce the next Electro House smash. <br /><br />This huge collection defines the surging adrenalized club vibes of electro house. Electro house is a sub-genre of house music that rose to become one of the most prominent genres of electronic dance music today. Stylistically, it combines the four to the floor beats commonly found in house music with harmonically rich analogue basslines, abrasive high-pitched leads and the occasional piano or string riff.<br /><br />The tempo of electro house ranges approximately from 120 to 135 bpm. Dirty house is a derivative of electro house, which is often much more commercial in its appeal and in general features more vocals. Electrotech is a darker variation of electro house mixed with the sound of tech house.<br /><br />Using the construction kit format, this package contains over 2.4GB, 3,580 files in total. Each kit has every element broken down in detail, including single hit samples, drum loops, bass loops, synth/key loops, etc. This collection is bursting at the seams with powerful basses, punishingly groovy percussions, sub dub basses, nail bitingly powerful synths, polished and mastered to perfection.<br /><br />In addition, this collection features bonus beats, single hit sounds and programs done in Kontakt 2, Battery 2, Emulator X, EXS 24, HALion, Reason NNXT and Sampletank. You have absolutely everything you need to produce the next Electro House smash.<br /><br />All beats have been processed using Neve, Soundcraft and SSL consoles at the mixing stage, so you know these are ready to go.<br /><br />If you are looking for those club vibes that have the edge to make it through the heaviest of deep electro set, give 'Platinum Electro House' a go. You are merely a vocal hook away from a hit.</p></div></blockquote><br /><br /><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://lulzimg.com/i23/c253de.png" /><br /><code><span style="color: #000000">
