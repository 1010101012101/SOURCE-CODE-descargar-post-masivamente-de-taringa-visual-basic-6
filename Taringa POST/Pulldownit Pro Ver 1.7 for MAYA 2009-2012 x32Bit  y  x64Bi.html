Its technology allows to pre-cut a 3D model in hundred of shards in seconds, in addition the fragments generated plug easily in the Pulldownit solver to perform simulation in a fast and reliable way.<br /><br /><b>Fracture capabilities</b><br /> The technology of fracture inside Pdi! is absolutely new and groundbreaking. It allows breaking apart any kind of brittle material like stone, glass or stucco. By using it digital artist are able to simulate the collapse of structures or terrain cracking in minutes. Not the least its easy setup and powerful stresstools allow for control in the creation of cracks and drive the simulation to the desired end.<br /><b>Animation friendly</b><br /> Pdi! is integrated in the most popular 3D packages, It catches the geometry from the viewports and computes the final result as animation keys, It allows to reset the simulation and start again as many as needed also tweaking parameters and resume simulation at any frame, in addition animated objects and characters are able to interact with the simulated ones.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=TXQ7QLEY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Download</a></div>								</span>
