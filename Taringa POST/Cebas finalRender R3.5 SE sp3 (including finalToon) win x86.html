A complementary copy of finalToon 3.5 is included with a purchase of either version.<br /><br /><b>Alice in (Stereo-) Wonderland</b><br /> The new finalRender SE Stereo Camera offers the 3ds Max user a sophisticated way to reproduce true 3D stereo camera effects from within 3ds Max.<br /> Sam Korshid, former effects Supervisor at CafeFX, approached cebas with an urgent need for a proper 3ds Max rendering solution.<br /> It needed to work out of the box, have no issues with live action footage, allow proper compositing of existing footage (created with thinkingParticles R4), and would match rendering setups created in Maya.<br /> Within the tight production timeline of “Alice in Wonderland,” cebas integrated a true 3D stereo camera model into finalRender, which proved to be an ideal rendering solution for this major production.<br /><br /><b>DomeLight</b><br /> finalRender R3 SE was the rendering system of choice for Uncharted Territory for the 3D VFX in the blockbuster movie “2012.” DomeLight proved to be the key lighting method used to create believable and fast global illumination scenery.<br /> It also showed great stability in ultra-complex scenes with thousands of animated objects, possessing millions of polygons.<br /> In finalRender 3.5, DomeLight is now faster, smoother and better than before, accelerating both the animation and QMC rendering modes.<br /><br /><b>Ocean Object and Material Enhancements</b><br /><br /> User input is very important to cebas. The latest feedback on Ocean Material and Ocean Object has led to more fine-tuning and upgrades in rendering and processing speed.<br /> Foam Map handling, for example, has seen a total overhaul.<br /><br /><b>Skin2 and CarPaint2</b><br /> In finalRender 3.5 SE, fR-Skin2 is a new layered skin material shader that resembles the effects of human (or alien) skin much better than the previous fR-Skin.<br /> fR-CarPaint2, with optional new material, makes the paint on your car model look exactly like a shiny, new car.<br /> Also, fR-FastSkin has been upgraded to allow full map control of its features.<br /> ...and More<br /><br /><b>Download Multiple Servers</b> (20 MB)<br /><br /><br /> <a href="http://uploadmirrors.com/download/0Y8KHG66/FinalRenderR3.5SESP3for3DSMAX201232Bit_64Bit.rar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://uploadmirrors.com/download/0Y8KHG66/FinalRenderR3.5SESP3for3DSMAX201232Bit_64Bit.rar</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.cebas.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Homepage</a></div>								</span>
